<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>When a channel access client, such as MEDM, wants to connect to a process
variable [PV], it broadcasts a search request, asking what server has this
process variable.  These are UDP broadcasts, which means there is no checking
whether the message actually arrives anywhere.  Each IOC or other channel
access server on the network should receive this broadcast message, however,
and when it does, it needs to search its process variables and see if it has
the one requested.  If it has the process variable, it sends a UDP message
back to the MEDM saying so, and then a two-way TCP connection is made to the
server (or an existing one is used), and the process variable is connected
for further access.  Messages over the TCP connection are reliable; that is,
they are checked for transmission errors and whether they are received or
not.</p>

<p>Note that for this guide we will often refer to the client as MEDM and the
server as an IOC.  This is because MEDM and IOCs are the most typical and
most used client and servers and most people are familiar with them.  Keep in
mind, however, that there are many other clients than MEDM and there are
other types of servers than an IOC.  CaSnooper is, in fact, another type of
server.</p>

<p>As long as MEDM does not get a message back that an IOC has the process
variable, it continues making these broadcasts at a decreasing rate until it
gives up (after 100 requests).  It has to do this, in part, because of the
unreliability of the UDP broadcasts.  This typically takes on the order of 8
minutes, but can be hours if many process variables are requested and not
found. Each server has to check to see if it has the process variable for
each broadcast.  This can put a significant load on the server.</p>

<p>In normal circumstances, however, this process happens rapidly.  One
server soon returns that it has the process variable; the broadcasts stop;
the TCP connection is made; and life goes on.  The worst case is when the
process variable does not exist anywhere.  Then the process continues to its
conclusion, causing unnecessary network traffic and load on the IOCs.</p>

<p>The search process starts again under certain circumstances, such as when
a new server is seen on the network, or when MEDM thinks a new server is
seen.  This search is only for unfound process variables, of course, and will
happen for all the nonexistent ones, causing more unnecessary traffic and
load on the IOCs.  The way MEDM knowns if a new server is seen involves
another set of UDP broadcasts, called beacons.  These come from the IOC. When
an IOC comes up, it sends beacons with a very short period.  The period is
doubled each time until it reaches EPICS_CA_BEACON_PERIOD, 15 sec. by
default. Then it sends them every EPICS_CA_BEACON_PERIOD seconds.  Clients
such as MEDM watch for changes in the beacon period.  A short period
indicates an IOC has come up. This is called a beacon anomaly.  A change from
something to zero, indicates one may have gone down.  (The clients do other
tests before concluding the IOC has gone down.)  In some cases there are
circumstances that lead MEDM to continuously think a new IOC has come up.
This can cause a really substantial load on the newtork and IOCs.  See <a
href="#History">History</a> and <a href="#Starting">Starting CaSnooper</a>
for examples.  A more complete description of these processes can be found in
the EPICS Channel Access Reference Manual (see <a
href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access</a>).</p>

<p>Useless and unnecessary searches for non-existent PVs can produce a
significant load on the IOCs, keeping them from doing important tasks or even
causing them to crash.  CaSnooper is a tool designed to monitor search
requests.  It is a server. Since it is a server, it gets all the requests
that the other servers get. However, instead of looking to see if it has the
process variables in the search request, it keeps track of the search
requests instead and displays the information in various forms.</p>

<p>CaSnooper could formerly be built with both EPICS Base 3.13 and 3.14, even
though the portable server implementation is significantly different in each
version of base.  It does not currently build with 3.14 because a needed
funcion has been made private and unavailable.  If this is a concern, you
should contact <a href="mailto:johill@lanl.gov">Jeff Hill</a> at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.</p>

href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/index.php">EPICS Documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="History">History</a></h3>

<p>CaSnooper was written by Kenneth Evans in 1999 as a tool to help
investigate IOC instability.  The first problem it helped solve was caused by
continuously repeated searches for non-existent process variables.  The
reason these searches were continuous was that beacons with the same
identification were coming from two servers.  Clients such as MEDM saw this
as a single beacon with a short period, indicating they should reissue their
search requests.  Since the period remained short, the clients searched
continuously, putting an extraordinary load on the IOCs and increasing the
traffic on the network.  The problem was caused by an error in configuring
the IP address of one of the servers.  The study also indicated that  many
non-existent process variables were being searched for.  These primarily came
from MEDM screens or IOCs that attempted to make connections to process
variable names that were misspelled or had changed.  Using the results from
CaSnooper, these screens and IOCs were found and cleaned up.  This lead to a
further increase in IOC stability and further reduced unnecessary IOC load
and network traffic.</p>

<h2><a name="Starting">Starting CaSnooper</a></h2>

<p>CaSnooper is started by typing the following on a command line:</p>
<pre>caSnooper [Options]</pre>

<p>The options are:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>-c&lt;integer&gt;</td>
      <td>Check validity of top n requests  (0 means all).  That is, try to
        connect to these process variables.  Timeout after 10 s.  See <a
        href="#Report">Report</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-d&lt;integer&gt;</td>
      <td>Set debug level to n.  Prints extra information for debugging.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-h</td>
      <td>Help.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-i&lt;string&gt;</td>
      <td>Specify a PV name to watch individually. The default is
        CaSnoop.test. (The default is not affected by setting the prefix with
        -n.) See <a href="#IndividualName">Individual Process Variable

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-l&lt;decimal&gt;</td>
      <td>Print all requests over n Hz.  See <a
      href="#Report">Report</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-p&lt;integer&gt;</td>
      <td>Print top n (0 means all).  See <a href="#Report">Report</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-n[&lt;string&gt;]</td>
      <td>Make internal PV names available.  Use string as prefix for
        internal PV names (10 chars max length). Default string is: CaSnoop.
        See <a href="#ProcessVariables">CaSnooper Process Variables</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-s&lt;integer&gt;</td>
      <td>Print all requests over n sigma.  See <a
      href="#Report">Report</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-t&lt;decimal&gt;</td>
      <td>Run n seconds, then print report.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-w&lt;decimal&gt;</td>
      <td>Wait n sec before collecting data.  Use to wait until searches
        resulting from CaSnooper's coming up are over.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There is no space between the switches and their value.  A typical command
line is:</p>
<pre>% caSnooper -t60 -p10 -c5</pre>

<p>See <a href="#Report">Report</a> for the report resulting from this
command line.</p>

<p>Requests are ordered by frequency, and the top requests are the ones with
the highest frequencies.</p>

<p>If the internal PV names are made available, it is necessary to be sure
there is only one copy of CaSnooper with that PV name prefix running on a
network to avoid duplicate PV names.</p>

<p>With EPICS 3.13, there should be no more than one portable server, such as
CaSnooper, running on a workstation.  The reason is that there is not
sufficient information in the beacons to distinguish among servers on the
same host.  Clients such as MEDM must treat their beacons as one set of
beacon signals and will see sum and difference frequencies.  They will likely
interpret this as an IOC coming up and will continuously reissue their search
requests.  As a result, if CaSnooper is one of two portable servers on the
same host, it will be causing a problem, rather than help solving it.  The
repeated searches should be seen in CaSnooper, however.  Two servers on the
same host should not be a problem with 3.14 servers.  It is not clear what
will happen with a mixture of 3.13 and 3.14 servers. That situation should be
avoided.  Hardware IOCs are their own host and do not have this problem.</p>

<h2><a name="Report">Report</a></h2>

<p>CaSnooper prints reports to standard output (stdout).  By default it
writes the number of requests, the number of different process variables
requested, and the maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the request
frequencies.  There are several command-line options to print more
information.  The following is an example of running for 60 s, printing the
top 10 requests (based on frequency), and asking to check if the top 5
process variables exist:</p>
<pre>% caSnooper -t60 -p10 -c5

<p>The first column is the index, the second column is the machine and port,
the third column is the name of the process variable, the fourth column in
the connection status list is whether it connected or not (NC means not
connected, C means connected), and the last column is the frequency in Hz. If
the port is 5064, it is probably an IOC running on the default port. Other
low-numbered ports are probably IOCs.  High-numbered ports are probably
TCP/IP connections, indicating an application such as MEDM is requesting the
process variable.</p>

<h2><a name="ProcessVariables">CaSnooper Process Variables</a></h2>

<p>CaSnooper publishes several process variables, allowing you to control it
and monitor the request rate.  By default these have the prefix "CaSnoop",
but this can be changed by <a href="#Starting">command-line options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.requestRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the total request rate in Hz.  It could be monitored in MEDM,
StripTool, or other clients.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.individualRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the request rate in Hz for the individual process variable if one
is specified.  See <a href="#IndividualPVName">Individual Process Variable
Name</a>.  It could be monitored in MEDM, StripTool, or other clients.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.test</strong></p>

<p>This is not a process variable published by CaSnooper.  It is the default
name for the individual process variable.  It is included here for reference.
This process variable may or may not exist, depending on if another IOC has
it.  You can also specify a different name for the individual process
variable.  See <a href="#IndividualName">Individual Process Variable Name</a>
for more details.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.nCheck</strong></p>

<p>This specifies the number of process variables for which to print the
connection status in the report.  0 is All and -1 is None.  It is the same as
setting -c on the <a href="#Starting">command-line</a>.  Checking means
trying to make an actual connection to these process variables.  The results
for the process variables with the top CaSnoop.nCheck rates will be checked
and appear in the report.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.nPrint</strong></p>

<p>This specifies the number of process variables for which to print results
in the report.  0 is All and -1 is None.   It is the same as setting -p on
the <a href="#Starting">command-line</a>.  The results for the process
variables with the top CaSnoop.nPrint rates will be included in the
report.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.nSigma</strong></p>

<p>This specifies the lower value of the standard deviation multiplier for
which to print results in the report. 0 is All and -1 is None.  It is the
same as setting -s on the <a href="#Starting">command-line</a>.  If a process
variable has a rate that falls above the standard deviation multiplied by
this number, its results will be included in the report.  For example, if
CaSnoop.nSigma is 2 and the standard deviation of all the results is .2 Hz,
then results for process variables with rates above .4 Hz will be printed.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.nLimit</strong></p>

<p>This specifies the lower limit in Hz for the report.  0 is All and -1 is
None.  It is the same as setting -l on the <a
href="#Starting">command-line</a>.  If a process variable has a rate above
this value, its results will be included in the report.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.repor</strong>t</p>

<p>Setting this to 1 causes CaSnooper to print a report.  It will be set to 0
after the report completes.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.reset</strong></p>

<p>Setting this to 1 causes CaSnooper to reset the counters and start a new
list of process variables.    It will be set to 0 after the reset.</p>

<p><strong>CaSnoop.quit</strong></p>

<p>Setting this to 1 causes CaSnooper to exit.</p>

<h2><a name="GUIInterface">GUI Interface</a></h2>

<p>Owing to its <a href="#ProcessVariables">published process variables</a>,
you can control CaSnooper via MEDM or another tool.  To do this you would
typically start CaSnooper via the command line:</p>
<pre>% caSnooper -n</pre>

<p>or</p>
<pre>% caSnooper -nMyPrefix</pre>

<p>if you want to specify another prefix.  You can then set the report
switches and cause CaSnooper to print reports, reset, or quit via its process
variables using a MEDM screen like the following:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="CaSnooper MEDM Interface"
src="CaSnooper.MEDM.gif"></p>

<p>(As a note: the graph shows what happens when an IOC comes up.)  This
screen just accesses the <a href="#ProcessVariables">CaSnooper process
variables</a>.  The Shell Command button labeled Start provides an option to
start CaSnooper using the following command:</p>
<pre>xterm -geometry 80x50+5+5 -fg black -bg white -title CaSnooper
  -mb -sk -sb -sl 512 -e runCaSnooper &amp;</pre>

<p>The script, here named runCaSnooper, that actually starts CaSnooper might
look like:</p>
<pre>#! /bin/csh
# Script used to run caSnooper
# Set server address
setenv EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST 164.54.8.167
# Set server port
setenv EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT 5064
# Handle ^C so the XTerm doesn't blow away
onintr EXIT
# Run and save the output in a log
caSnooper -n |&amp; tee caSnooper.log
EXIT: echo Type CR to dismiss this XTerm
$&lt; </pre>

<p>This script first sets some <a href="#Environment">EPICS environment
variables</a>, then runs CaSnooper, making the internal process variables
available.  It handles an interrupt so the XTerm does not immediately
disappear after a Ctrl-C interrupt or stopping CaSnooper via CaSnoop.quit.
The output is saved in a log, which is reused.  Of course, you can make as
simple or complicated a script as you wish.</p>

<p>Both the MEDM ADL file for this screen and the script are included in the
CaSnooper distribution.</p>

<h2><a name="IndividualName">Individual Process Variable Name</a></h2>

<p>CaSnooper watches one single process variable individually and apart from
the list of others.  It publishes the rate in a separate process variable,
CaSnoop.individualRate.  See <a href="#ProcessVariables">CaSnooper Process
Variables</a>.  You can specify the name of this process variable on the <a
href="#Starting">command line</a> via the -i switch.  The default is
CaSnoop.test.  If this process variable does not exist, you can use it to see
the pattern of search requests for a process variable that doesn't exist.</p>

<h2><a name="Environment">Environment Variables</a></h2>

<p>CaSnooper has no environment variables of its own; however, it is affected
by EPICS environment variables such as EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST.  These are some of
the environment variables that would most commonly be used with CaSnooper.
See <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access </a> below for more
information.</p>

<table border="1">

    <tr>
      <td>EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDRESS</td>

        the EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDRESS of CaSnooper if there is more than one
