Version 1-10-0g-beta
--------------------

Default pvtype under the old generic pv scheme used to be "epics".
This is now translated to EPICS.

Popup buttons now created with XmNpopupEnabled set to false.

Add wheel mouse support to up/down button, slider, motif slider
(just experimenting for the moment).


Version 1-10-0e-beta
--------------------

Related display widget and embedded window features added.

Macro symbol definition may now include the following syntax forms:

  s1=v1,s2=v2,...        (this variation is currently supported)

      or

  @<filename>

      or

  @<filename> s1=v1,s2=v2,...

In the 2nd and 3rd variations, macro definitions will be read from the
first line of an ascii file. Optionally (as shown by the 3nd variation), a
list of inline definitions will be appended to the definitions obtained
from the file.


Version 1-10-0d-beta
--------------------

Fixed bit edit pvs bitmask


Version 1-10-0c-beta
--------------------

Fixed problem with button press/release actions. When member of a group, if
button is pushed, mouse pointer moves away from putton, and then button
is released, the release action is not seen by the button.


Version 1-10-0b-beta
--------------------

Default pv type specified in display properties now works.


Version 1-10-0beta
------------------

Changes since 1-9-6:

  o All widgets now utilize the pv_factory facility

  o The file format is now based on a tag/value scheme; it's not
    yet XML but it is a definite improvement. Reading of old format
    files is still supported but write operations will employ the new
    format which will not be forward compatible with older versions
    of edm. You should therefore archive existing edl files before
    upgrading to the new version.

  o The embedded widget now supports scrolling and macros.

  o Edit-mode drag-and-drop has been implemented using
    a ctrl-middle-button mouse operation. Raw PV names
    (i.e. names with untranslated macro references) may
    be obtained from widgets in this manner.

  o Medm-like group visibility has been added and there are
    two associated edit-mode operations: "copy group visibility info"
    and "paste group visibility info". These may be used with
    an ungroup-edit-group sequence to copy and restore the group
    visibility information.
