CALC1 -*- shell-script -*-

# Example definition file for the CALC ProcessVariable
#
# First line "CALC1 ..." is magic and provides version number
# as well as EMACS mode with is not necessary
# but makes for - by definition - cool coloring
# when this file is edited in emacs.

# For now this file has to be called "calc.list"
# and has to be
# a) in the current directory
# b) accessible as $EDMFILES/calc.list
#
# Suggestions are welcome regarding how EDM should
# locate and load additional calculation definitions.
#
# Empty lines and comments like these,
# beginning with '#', are ignored.
#
# Syntax for the rest of the file:
#
# <name>
# <implementation>
#
# The name is used to refer to a CALC PV aa "CALC\name"
# or "CALC\name(argA, argB, argC, ...).
#
# Implementation is in EPICS CALC record syntax,
# with A, B, C, ... being variable names for the arguments.
#
# Usage Examples:
#
# "CALC\sum(fred, jane)"
# executes the definition of "sum" with
#  A = value of fred
#  B = value of jane
# whenever either PV changes.
# The time stamp of the result is the most recent of the PVs'.
# If no time stamp is available from any of the arguments,
# the current host time is used.
#
# Status/severity are maximized,
# i.e. if fred is in ??/MINOR and jane in READ/INVALID,
# the result will be READ/INVALID.
#
# The remaining PV properties (display limits, ...)
# are currently undefined for a CALC PV,
# the plan is to add configuration parameters
# that will become part of this file.
#
# Note: arguments are not checked!
# If e.g. CALC\sum(a,b) requires two arguments,
# nonone cares if you provide 0, 2 or 5 arguments instead of 2.
# See the random example below on why this is a feature.

# Example: CALC\sum(x, y) will summarize the arguments
sum   
# Implementation:
A+B


# Example: CALC\F2C(t)
# transforms given Fahrenheit-Temperature into much more
# meaningful Deg. C
F2C
# Implementation:
(A-32)*5/9



# Formula to create random number.
# This one does not need arguments.
# With no PV input, this one will never update!
# Possible circumvention: Provide a PV just to
# trigger recalculation, e.g. use
#    "CALC\random(some_1Hz_PV)"
# to see changes at ~1Hz.
random
# Implementation:
RNDM
