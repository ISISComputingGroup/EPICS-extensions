<h1>Textentry</h1>
Based on the <a href="textupdate.htm">textupdate widget</a>,
this widget displays the value of a PV and allows to enter new
values.<br>

<h2>Properties</h2>
All properties are inherited from the
<a href="textupdate.htm">textupdate widget</a>

<H2>Detail on Behaviour</H2>
There is a <I>update</I> and <I>edit</I> mode.
In update mode, new values of the PV are displayed. But if
the PV is constantly changing, it is hard to enter a new
value because the new value will always overwrite
what you just entered.
Therefore the widget will switch to edit mode, i.e. "freeze"
after the cursor is moved inside the widget.
This means you get into edit mode as soon as you enter anything, use
the cursor keys or click the mouse inside the textentry widget.
Now you can edit the content undisturbed, until you either leave the
widget by selecting another widget, in which case all entries are
lost and replaced by the current value of the PV, or you press
ENTER, in which case the entered value is sent to the PV.
