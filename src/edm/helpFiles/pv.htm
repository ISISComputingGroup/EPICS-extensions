<h1>ProcessVariables</h1>

<font color=red>
Note: Not all widgets might support the full
syntax as described in here. For those you can only
provide a PV name</font><br>

Most widgets can react to ProcessVariables (PVs):
They usually display the current value of the PV as a
text, number or e.g. as a meter.
Even seemingly static elements like lines can change their
color based on the value of a PV.<br>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

EDM has the option of supporting several types of PVs.
When simply providing a PV name, the default type of PV
is used (usually EPICS). Otherwise, the type of PV is
selected via a prefix:

<pre>
     name
     EPICS\name
     CALC\name(argA, argB, argC, ...)
     XYZ\name
</pre>

<UL>
<LI><B>name</B><br>
    The name of the PV, for example an EPICS channel name like
    "fred" (served by excas, the Example ChannelAccess server)
    or "sys_subsys:device:signal" for SNS names.
<LI><B>EPICS\</B><br>
    Forces "name" to be an EPICS channel name (might be the default).
<LI><B>CALC\</B><br>
    Forces "name" to be a <a href="calcpv.htm">CALC PV.</a>
<LI><B>XYZ\</B><br>
    Forces "name" to be of type XYZ (not implemented).
</UL>

<h2>API</h2>

If you want to implement a new widget, please refer to
